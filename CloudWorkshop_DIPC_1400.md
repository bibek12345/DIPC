finished successfully or failed.


1.  Log into your DIPC server, provide the URL (it should look like
    this): https://dipc01-orasenatdpltintegration02.adipc.ocp.oraclecloud.com/dicloud/app/index.html

4.  This page will hold Summary for all the jobs, and then pages for
    these three specific types of jobs created from these tasks:
    Synchronize Data, Replicate Data and Data Lake Management. Each of
    these pages has three tiles and a table:
    ![](images/1400/image1100_2.png)


    - **Agent Health:** The Agent Health tile reports whether capture and delivery
    plugins related to Oracle Data Integration Platform Cloud tasks are running
    on the data sources or not which is different from the status of the agents
    displayed on the Agents page.

    - **Job Health:** The Job Health tile located in the Monitor page of Oracle
    Data Integration Platform Cloud displays information for all the Jobs
    ever run on the server.

    - **Top Duration Report:** The Top Duration tile in the Summary page of Monitor
    displays the top three jobs with the longest duration. Duration of a job is
    the job's end time minus its start time.

    - **Top Data Report:** The Top Data Report tile displays the top three Jobs
    with highest throughput in the past three days. Throughput is the number
    of operations replicated in the past three days in Megabytes/second.

    - **Top Lag Report:** The Top Lag Report tile displays the top three running
    Jobs with the most lag. The replication lag is calculated as difference in
    seconds between the time that a record was processed in the target and the
    timestamp of that process received through Data Integration Platform
    Cloud’s running agents on the source.
