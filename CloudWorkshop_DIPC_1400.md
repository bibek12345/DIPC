# Lab 1400 - Monitoring Jobs and Working with Policies

Before You Begin
----------------
### Introduction

This lab will explain the monitoring part of the DIPC, also on how to create policies and notifications for your tasks.

### Objectives

-   Monitor Jobs
-   Create Policies

## Time to Complete

Approximately 10 Minutes.

### What Do You Need?

Your will need:

-   DIPC Instance URL

-   DIPC User and Password

-   You must have Tasks and Jobs running.

## Monitor Jobs


The Monitor page displays information about all the Jobs ever started in
Data Integration Platform, whether they\'re running or stopped, already
finished successfully or failed.


1.  Log into your DIPC server, provide the URL (it should look like
    this): https://dipc01-orasenatdpltintegration02.adipc.ocp.oraclecloud.com/dicloud/app/index.html

2.  Provide your user name and password, then click \"Sign In\" button.

    Or, if you are already in the application, go to the \"Home\" page by selecting the \"Home\" hyperlink from the left panel.


3.  In the Home Page click on \"Monitor\" located at the left side.

4.  This page will hold Summary for all the jobs, and then pages for
    these three specific types of jobs created from these tasks:
    Synchronize Data, Replicate Data and Data Lake Management. Each of
    these pages has three tiles and a table:
    ![](images/1400/image1100_2.png)


    - **Agent Health:** The Agent Health tile reports whether capture and delivery
    plugins related to Oracle Data Integration Platform Cloud tasks are running
    on the data sources or not which is different from the status of the agents
    displayed on the Agents page.

    - **Job Health:** The Job Health tile located in the Monitor page of Oracle
    Data Integration Platform Cloud displays information for all the Jobs
    ever run on the server.

    - **Top Duration Report:** The Top Duration tile in the Summary page of Monitor
    displays the top three jobs with the longest duration. Duration of a job is
    the job's end time minus its start time.

    - **Top Data Report:** The Top Data Report tile displays the top three Jobs
    with highest throughput in the past three days. Throughput is the number
    of operations replicated in the past three days in Megabytes/second.

    - **Top Lag Report:** The Top Lag Report tile displays the top three running
    Jobs with the most lag. The replication lag is calculated as difference in
    seconds between the time that a record was processed in the target and the
    timestamp of that process received through Data Integration Platform
    Cloud’s running agents on the source.



###   Here is how you can see all the jobs created in previous labs.

## Create Policies


**Policies** enable you to specify conditions for when and how often a job
should run and when you should be notified.

You're alerted to new notifications within the **Data Integration Platform
Cloud console**. The alert icon at the top of the page displays the number
of new notifications you have.


### Create a New Notification Policy


A **Notification** is an alert that you receive in Data Integration Platform
Cloud when Notification Policy conditions are met.

To view your notifications,
click the **Notifications** icon, displayed as a bell, accessible from
any page in your Data Integration Platform Cloud console.

1.  On the Policies page, click **Create**, and then
    select **Notification Policy**.
